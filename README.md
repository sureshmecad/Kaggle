# Kaggle
Projects handled in Kaggle Competition


Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.
Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment,
work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.


How Kaggle competitions work

1. The competition host prepares the data and a description of the problem.
2. Participants experiment with different techniques and compete against each other to produce the best models. Work is shared publicly
through Kaggle Kernels to achieve a better benchmark and to inspire new ideas. Submissions can be made through Kaggle Kernels, through
manual upload or using the Kaggle API. For most competitions, submissions are scored immediately (based on their predictive accuracy
relative to a hidden solution file) and summarized on a live leaderboard.
3. After the deadline passes, the competition host pays the
prize money in exchange for "a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free license [...] to use the winning Entry", i.e. the
algorithm, software and related intellectual property developed, which is "non-exclusive unless otherwise specified".
